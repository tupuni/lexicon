# Working group for SDS recording system

## General information about SDS
The recording system SDS (german Systematische und digitale Erfassung
von Steinartefakten) offers a recording system for stone artefacts. It is a  compilation of existing systems from the Upper Paleolithic to the Neolithic and was designed to serve as a starting point for systematic and quantitative analysis with a uniform coding and standardized listing system of the conventional attributes recorded for lithic inventories. Therewith, a valuable basis for comparative analysis and digital exchange of the data should be guaranteed.

The system was first published in 2008 (https://doi.org/10.12766/jna.2008.25), with additional work based on it, e.g. on Neolithic flint material of Northern Germany (https://doi.org/10.12766/jna.2013.03) and supplements for the classification and denomination of projectiles and inset-blades (https://doi.org/10.12766/2014.2). 

The SDS was used as a recording system for several dissertation and MA theses. 
In 2018, a R Shiny Webapp sdsbrowser, initially developed by Clemens Schmid([github](https://github.com/Johanna-Mestorf-Academy/sdsbrowser)), aimed at making the available SDS datasets more accessible.
The available datasets are curated via the [sdsbrowser](https://sds.ufg.uni-kiel.de/), at Kiel University, maintained by [Christoph Rinne](https://www.ufg.uni-kiel.de/en/staff-directory/scientific-collaborators/christoph-rinne).
Through this, several adaptations and additions have been made by the authors, as well as people further working on it. 

Until now, no broader revision of the published version has been published nor an english translation in order to facilitate international collaborations on its basis.

## Aim of the project
The project aims to gather existing revisions and additions of the SDS system in order to build an integrated updated version of the SDS, as well as a translated version in english. 

## Structure of the SDS system 
The SDS is a modular attribute catalogue that is organized in different forms, following the preceeding SAP system - specific forms are destined for specific types of lithic finds.
- **Form 1**: Basic information about the site and the object, applicable for all lithic finds (flint objects, polished stone tools, millstones etc.)
- **Form 2** is for the recording of specific objects. It is further split depending on the blank type and material: 
    - **2A** for flakes and blades
    - **2B** for cores
    - **2C** for rocks, arrow shaft smoothers and raddles
    - **2D** for adzes. 
- **Form 3** was destined to record positions of retouches. 
- **Form 4** is specifically for projectile points and microliths. 
- **Form 5** is specifically for microburins.
- **Form 6** was destined to record refittings.
