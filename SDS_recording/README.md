# SDS recording system

## General information about SDS
The recording system SDS (in german Systematische und digitale Erfassung
von Steinartefakten) offers a recording system for stone artefacts. This compilation of existing systems from the Upper Paleolithic to the Neolithic should serve as a starting point for systematic and quantitative analysis with a uniform coding and standardized listing system of the conventional attributes recorded at lithic inventories. Therewith a valuable basis for comparative analysis and digital exchange of the data should be guaranteed.

The system was first published in 2008 (https://doi.org/10.12766/jna.2008.25), with additional work based on it, e.g. on Neolithic flint material of Northern Germany (https://doi.org/10.12766/jna.2013.03) and supplements for the classification and denomination of projectiles and inset-blades (doi.org/10.12766/2014.2). 

The SDS was used as a recording system for several dissertation and MA theses. Some of the databases are curated via the [sdsbrowser] (https://sds.ufg.uni-kiel.de/), at Kiel University, maintained by [CristophRinne] (https://www.ufg.uni-kiel.de/en/staff-directory/scientific-collaborators/christoph-rinne).
